* New World load progress bar thanks to @kotmatross28729
* Footprint z-fighting prevention with shaders thanks to @kotmatross28729
* Footprints now properly render under water
* Breath particles now render in RenderWorldLastEvent instead of EffectRenderer, making them render AFTER water
* Performance fixes, thanks to kotmatross
  * Replace GL11.glBindTexture(GL11.GL_TEXTURE_2D, previousTexture); with mc.getTextureManager().bindTexture(TextureMap.locationBlocksTexture); in FootprintManager
  * Removed OpenGlHelper.setActiveTexture and GL11.glGetInteger in FootprintManager
* Added Dragon Block C compat when aiming in Decoupled Camera mode
* Added cameraVerticalOffset to config. Setting it to 0.8 compensates for DBC lowering it
* Fixed computeAimRotation raycasting blocks behind the camera
